## Overview of Project
Discovering trends in newer cryptocurrencies using unsupervised machine learning.

## Code File Breakdown

The `crypto_clustering.ipynb` file is divided into 4 deliverables

### Deliverable 1

The purpose of deliverable 1 was to clean the data and scale it to be used for the second deliverable.

### Deliverable 2

The second purpose was to reduce the data dimensions using Principal component analysis (PCA).

### Deliverable 3

The third purpose was to use the K-Means algorithm to cluster the cryptocurrencies, making use of the elbow curve method to decide a potential optimal number of clusters.

### Deliverable 4

The purpose of deliverable 4 was to visualize the results by providing images such as the figures below.
